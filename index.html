    In olden times when wishing still helped one, there lived a
    king whose daughters were all beautiful; and the youngest was
    so beautiful that the sun itself, which has seen so much, was
    astonished whenever it shone in her face. Close by the king's
    castle lay a great dark forest, and under an old lime-tree in the
    forest was a well, and when the day was very warm, the king's
    child went out into the forest and sat down by the side of the
    cool fountain: and when she was bored she took a golden ball,
    and threw it up on high and caught it; and this ball was her
    favorite plaything.</div> -->
